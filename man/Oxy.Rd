\title{Average minimum distance between boundary elements of two variables}
\usage{
Oxy(x, y, null_distrib)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A RasterLayer object with boundary elements.}

\item{y}{A RasterLayer object with boundary elements.}

\item{null_distrib}{A list of functions representing probability distributions. Output from overlap_null_distrib().}
}
\value{
p-value
}
\description{
Statistical test for the average minimum distance between boundary elements in two raster layers.
Uses Euclidean distance. Boundaries for each trait affect one another reciprocally (x affects y
and y affects x).
}
\examples{
soil_raster <- raster('soil_types.asc')
genetic_raster <- raster('genetic_assignment_probabilities.asc')

overlap_null_distribs <- overlap_null_distrib(soil_raster, genetic_raster, n_iterations = 1000,
                                              y_convert = T, threshold = 0.1, projection = 4326)
genetic_boundaries <- define_boundary(genetic_raster)

Oxy(soil_boundary, genetic_boundary, overlap_null_distribs)
