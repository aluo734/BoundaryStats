Title: Calculation of Boundary Overlap Statistics
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Amy Luo
Maintainer: Amy Luo <aluo@vols.utk.edu>
Description: Functions to calculate boundary and boundary overlap statistics for
    two spatially distributed traits using raster data. If data are trait values,
    trait data are transformed to boundary intensities based on approximate first
    derivatives across latitude and longitude. The package can conduct statistical
    boundary and boundary overlap tests and produce null distributions for those
    tests using the input data.
